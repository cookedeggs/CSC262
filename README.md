In Java, both arrays and ArrayLists are used to store collections of data, but they serve different purposes and have distinct behaviors. Arrays are fixed in size and can store either primitive types or objects. Once an array is created, its size cannot change, making it efficient but inflexible. Accessing elements is fast, but adding or removing elements requires manual adjustments, such as shifting or resizing.
ArrayLists, on the other hand, are part of the Java Collections Framework and are dynamically sized. They can only store objects, not primitives, but they provide built-in methods like .add(), .remove(), and .contains() to manage elements more easily. This makes them ideal for situations where the number of elements can change frequently.
To demonstrate these differences, I created a Java project called "Difference Arrays ArrayLists." It shows how arrays require fixed sizes and manual assignment, while ArrayLists allow flexible resizing and built-in manipulation. The project was compiled, run successfully, and then uploaded to GitHub for reference.
This project helped clarify how arrays are better suited for performance-critical and size-predictable data, while ArrayLists are more convenient for everyday use where flexibility is required.
